add docker scripts to streamline usage
  docker/roscore       # starts roscore and runs in background
  docker/process_bag   # processes a single test bag, maybe launching in webviz browser
add environment variables for whether it is a car or local, maybe even bag path
add documentation on how to run with a real car lidar
jiggle live mode where it is a ros service (currently reads bag directly as fast as it can)
